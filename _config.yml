              San Francisco, officially the City and County of San Francisco, is the cultural, commercial, 
              and financial center of Northern California and the only consolidated city-county in 
              California. San Francisco encompasses a land area of about 46.9 square miles
              on the northern end of the San Francisco Peninsula, which makes it the smallest county in 
              the state. It has a density of about 18,187 people per square mile, making it the most 
              densely settled large city in the state of California and the second-most densely populated 
              major city in the United States after New York City. San Francisco is the fourth-most 
              populous city in California, after Los Angeles, San Diego and San Jose, and the 
              13th-most populous city in the United Statesâ€”with a Census-estimated 2014 population 
              of 852,469. The city and its surrounding areas are known as the San Francisco Bay Area, 
              and are a part of the larger OMB designated San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland combined 
              statistical area, the fifth most populous in the nation with an estimated population of 
              8.6 million.
