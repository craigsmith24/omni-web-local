    The majestic downslope of Pacific Heights gives way to this area - overlooking the Golden Gate and gorgeous views 
    beyond the Bay. The homes can be stately (maybe gargantuan), as are many of the older apartment buildings. While space 
    may not be as big of an issue for many, the convenience to storage facilities is almost non-existent, and the cost of 
    real estate makes the limited options closeby much pricier than average. With the Golden Gate Bridge almost within 
    reach, the area makes the trip to hiking and biking trails, wine country adventure, and ski excursions an easy escape.
