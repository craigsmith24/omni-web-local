description: >
    An epicenter of both enterprise and nightlife, SoMa is home to the biggest building developments in San Francisco as 
    well as a high density of tech startups - making it one of the hottest neighborhoods for recent Bay Area transplants. 
    While a multitude of gorgeous new high rises boast spectacular views and convenience, many of the luxury condos, lofts 
    and apartments lack closet space. While some buildings have some storage on site, availability is limited and often 
    very expensive.
