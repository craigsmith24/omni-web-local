description: >
    As the heart of the city, the Downtown area- including Union Square, the Tenderloin and Chinatown -  is a never-ending 
    barrage of activity, and encompasses all socioeconomic and cultural groups. Home to some of the cityâ€™s oldest buildings
    - as well as some of the newest - the living spaces are small, as are many of the older businesses. Square footage,
    even in the more abrasive Tenderloin area, is at a premium.
