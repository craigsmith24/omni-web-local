    It’s hard to talk about anything other than the staggering, enviable, spectacular views in South Beach (a total 
    misnomer-- no sand in sight), which rides alongside the Embarcadero at one of the most scenic edges of the city 
    Skirting the strip of land between SoMa and the San Francisco Bay, South Beach is home to posh residential towers and
    pier-side warehouses, visited by the occasional wandering tourist in-the-know. While it hardly looks residential, South
    Beach is studded with towering condominiums. Tehre are few options for self-storage outside of what was built in each 
    highrise, making extra space both coveted and expensive.
