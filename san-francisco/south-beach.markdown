        It’s hard to talk about anything other than the staggering, enviable, spectacular views in South Beach (a total
        misnomer, there's no sand in sight), which rides alongside the Embarcadero at one of the most scenic edges of the
        city, extending only a few blocks back into SoMa. South Beach is home to posh residential towers and pier-side
        warehouses, as well as innumerable offices in both stately skyscrapers and tucked-away converted factories. The 
        area hardly feels residential as a result, but is brimming with condominiums and apartments built for long-term 
        living. There are few options for self-storage outside of what was built into each high rise, and the scarcity has 
        made storage and extra space both coveted and expensive.
