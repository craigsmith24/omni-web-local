description: >
    A former haven of blue collar industry, the Dogpatch has been ramping up as one of the more desirable residential
    neighborhoods, with modern condo communities staking claim to renovated warehouses and new construction. Since
    2005, dozens of diverse businesses have staked their claim in the sprawling industrial spaces, including wineries,
    manufacturers, retail outposts, art cooperatives, and restaurants. Optimized for the influx of newcomers to the
    area, storage is limited for businesses and residents alike.
