description: >
    Having quickly evolved from working-class neighborhood, to hipster enclave, to the
    high-design-and-gourmet mecca that Mark Zuckerberg now calls home, the
    Mission is one of the more coveted neighborhoods for renters and home buyers
    alike, with notoriously tiny inventory… and living spaces. New developments boast
    7-figure condos with limited closets, and the older split level multi-family Victorian
    houses are configured with shotgun floor plans that make for small rooms and
    precious little storage.
