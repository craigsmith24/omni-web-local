Omni Bootstrap
==============
Client libraries and theme for Omni web apps

Getting Started
---------------
First, you'll need to install dependencies using [Bower][2]:

```sh
bower install
```

Now you should be able to include the bootstrap files into your application

Theme
-----
The bootstrap library currently exposes a single Omni theme, which you can import into your existing SASS application:

```scss
@import "omni-bootstrap/assets/stylesheets/omni"
```

The theme is meant to override the default styles in the [bootstrap-sass][1] project.
